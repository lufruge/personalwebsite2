      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>Since first gaining exposure to coding at the end of my college career I knew I'd want to learn more about software development. Finally the perfect storm of circumstances led to me taking a leap of faith and starting a coding bootcamp. </p>
      <p>As someone who loves learning this journey has been amazing thus far. And I'm excited to begin on my career path in software development.</p>
      <p>Outside of work I'm an avid cook. I love working on and developing me recipes. Trying to work on a new difficult technique and being able to create amazing dishes. Some of my favorite recipes that I've developed so far include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decadent Fudge Brownies</li>
        <li>Southern Style Crab Cakes</li>
        <li>Chocolate Chip Cookies</li>
        <li>Homemade Lasagna</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I also love traveling. At the time of me writing this I've recently returned from a ski trip to Utah and it was absolutely amazing. Even though I'm definitely a far ways away from making it on an olympic podium any time soon, I am excited to get back to the slopes soon. </p>
